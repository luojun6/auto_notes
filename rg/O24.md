**Light commercial vehicles customer performances**

Light commercial vehicle performances are specific. Their main mission is to meet the requirements and expectations of business customers which are different from those of the customers of passenger cars.

The business customers of light commercial vehicles can be classified into three categories which reflect their activity:

- delivery staff, to transport equipment, packages
- site personnel, to transport equipment, aggregates and people
- artisans, who also use their vehicle as an office

These specificities are not always easy to reconcile when developing a product.

### 1.2 Organization Distribution

**Customer Performance Department**

![O24_2](./images/O24_2.png)

### 1.3 The 4 Major Aeras of Focus

To successfully complete its mission, the DEATP relies on **four major areas of focus**:
- understand 
- translate
- monitor 
- analyze

They **ensure that the customer expectations are taken into account** and applied during the framing and development of the vehicle projects.

This is done **in compliance with** 
- the basics of the group’s brand identity
- standardization recommendations by modules
- QCDP objectives.

These four major areas of focus are as follows:

![O24_3](./images/O24_3.png)

- **Understanding** what our customers want and value in all the markets where Groupe Renault sells vehicles, especially through knowledge of the competition.

- **Translating** these performances into requirement levels which can be used by the design engineers of parts and systems.

- **Monitoring** the convergence of engineering to the contractualized performance levels.

- **Analyzing** the customer satisfaction survey results and management, with the Quality Department, and their improvement.

![O24_4](./images/O24_4.png)

**Challenges**
- **Contribution to the appeal**
    - The achievement of these four areas of focus enables contribution to the appeal

- **Contribute to customer satisfaction**
    - Achievement of customers satisfaction level, which is compliant with our brand identity targets, their expectations, and Product Department targets.

- **Contribute to the OverAll Opinion**
    - They must contribute to the OverAll Opinion, in collaboration with the Quality Department.

### 1.4 Performance Contract

- **Performance contract between INT and CF**
<br>
From the Intention milestone to the concept-freeze or CF milestone, it is the support used to manage the definition of performance targets and formalize the potential for achievement of these targets by the different vehicle concepts.

- **Performance contract between CF and VPC**
<br>
From the concept-freeze to the pre-contract vehicle, or VPC, it is the support used to manage the convergence of performances, with regard to the technical definition.

- **Performance contract at the VPC milestone**
<br>
The pre-contract vehicle milestone formalizes the performance contract. It corresponds to the pre-commitment of all the project participants on the car which will be developed later and the level of performances to be achieved.

It's signed by:
- Program Director
- Product Director
- Chief Engineer
- Director of Customer Performances Engineering

- **Performance contract between VPC and MA**

For each milestone and from the latest update of the DTVH, the forecast of each performance sector are incorporated into the performance contract.

## 2 Specificties of Processes

### 2.1 Mapping

![O24_5](./images/O24_5.png)
![O24_6](./images/O24_6.png)
The main interactions are carried out with the following processes:

- For the powertrain, with process **O14**, Manage the powertrain or GMP performances convergence

- For the vehicle, there are four processes: 
    - **O20**, Frame the vehicle projects
    - **O26**, Arbitrate and manage the projects under development, including derivative versions
    - **O50**, Manage the Product/Process/Performance/Stying convergence geometry, and perceived quality of the vehicle
    - **O54**, Design and validate the vehicle parts under development and during life cycle

- The processes common to the powertrain and the vehicles:
    - **O34**, Develop and maintain the test facilities, perform the tests
    - **O53**, Design and validate the systems
    - **O83**, Manage and provide the digital mock-ups and simulation models

### 2.2 V3P Logic

Process O24 covers the entire development schedule of new vehicles, from the Intention to the MA. How the scope of process O24 is included in the V3P development logic through the following phases:

![O24_7](./images/O24_7.png)

- **Robust Framework: define the performance target**
    - For the robust framework, the main input data are:
        - product intention
        - customer surveys
        - CAC, analysis of the competition
        - métier data
        - project QCDP objectives

    - Based on this data, the first phase – robust framework – can start. It involves defining the performance targets through the following activities:
        - setting the performance targets
        - formalizing the specifications
        - defining the validation plan

    - The expected results are as follows:
        - performance contract, levels two, three and four, framed
        - validation plan defined
        - CDCPF, levels five and six circulated
            - CDCPF: Cahier Des Charges Prestations Functionneles, Functional Services Specifications

![O24_8](./images/O24_8.png)

- **Optimization: Optimize the DT to meet the target performance**
    - The second phase is used to optimize the technical definition, to achieve the performance targets, in the QCDP package, through the following activities:
        - confirm that the platform is adapted
        - refine the requirements
        - define the prototype needs
        - identify the list of kits
    - The expected results are as follows:
        - performance contract, levels two, three and four, signed
        - formalized validation plan, REVS
        - functional performances specification, levels five and six frozen, RFQ function by lot

- **Development and industrialization: Access and monitor the performance convergence**
    - The third and fourth phases – development and industrialization – enable assessment and monitoring of the convergence of performances through the following activities:
        - analyze the results of the defined validation plan
        - assess the compliance of the specification, levels five and six, and on the performance contract level three
        - define and apply the kits, all versions, few versions or optional
        - ormalizes the milestone performances forecasts
    - The expected results are as follows:
        - For the Contract and TGA milestones: 
            - performances forecast 
            - validation plan applied
            - specified kits
        - Then for the milestones between TGA and MA:
            - performances forecast and validation plan applied
            - Then, at the MA milestone: performances status and improvement of customer satisfaction
