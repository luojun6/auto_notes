O51 Process, “Ensure the Electrical Electronic Product Process Feature convergence”, is part of the finality three of the quality management system of engineering, i.e.: “provide the plant with components to manufacture a car which is compliant, which can be sold and which can be repaired during After-Sales”.

![O51_finality_3](./images/O51_finality_3.png)

Federative O51 process, “Ensure the Electrical Electronic Product Process Feature convergence”, interacts with a number of other federative processes.

Among the most important, we can mention, among others:

- For powertrain, the process O32 “Design the powertrain calibrated control system”, for example, using which the interface contracts between engine development and vehicle development are contractualised.

- For the vehicle: The process O54 "Design and validate the vehicle parts in development and during life cycle", which provides, for example, the ECUs for the EIPF, and O55 “Ensure the convergence of Product Process service convergence for diagnosis” which will define the diagnostic bases, in particular.

- Then the processes common to powertrain and vehicle: O52 “Design and validate the embedded software” with which we ensure the convergence of software development, and O53 “Design and validate systems”, which for example delivers the system design document.

        - The forms are distributed across the various system meshes.
        - E/Electronic Features Engineering Leader (EFGL Leader) is responsible for this activity.

    - **FA: Architecture Form**
        - In the FA of each feature we find:Network and wire-based Inter System Requests, network messages, ECUs, sensors, actuators, power supply levels of the EE parts, as well as the description of the EE feature. The FA is an inter system electronic synthesis of EE feature.

    - **ISR: Inter System Request**
        - An ISR corresponding to one single inter system requirements.
        - An ISR is an inter-system exchanges requirements  wire-based or multi-network (CAN, LIN, Eth, etc).

## 6 Conclusion 

![O51_13](./images/O51_13.png)

![O51_14](./images/O51_14.png)


**To remember:**

- O51 Process interacts with the following processes:
    - O52 – Design and validate the embedded software
    - O53 – Design and validate systems
    - O54 – Design and validate vehicles parts in development and during life cycle
    - O55 – Ensure the convergence of product process service convergence for diagnosis
    - O32 – Design the powertrain calibrated control system

- O51 Process begins as soon as the Intention milestone to ensure a robust framing of the EE architecture.

- At the CF milestone, the list of features must be defined and the innovations must be decided (0 K1 related to the integration of electronic features). Any post-CF modification impacting the EE architecture must be accepted through the Change Request process.

- At the VPC milestone, the EE architecture is defined. It is no longer possible to modify the architecture without QCD risk.

- The EIPF ensures the timing of the O51 process and represents a federative tool to pull the convergence of the EE parts. It implies that these parts are delivered on time and with the right level of hardware and software representativity for each integration loop.

- No SW can be deployed at the plant without being tested first on EIPF.

- The Vehicle EE Architect is the operationnal leader of the O51 process in project phase.
