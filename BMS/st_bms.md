## Battery management design considerations

- Service life
    - Degradation in performance
    - Replacement cost

- Efficiency
    - Range, range/charge(and charge time)
    - Energy density (energy capacity by weight and by volume)

- Safety
    - No thermal runaway

- Operational parameters
    - Fuel garging
    - Cell balancing
    - Thermal management
