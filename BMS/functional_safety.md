## Function Safety

**ISO2622 requirements in HV battery pack current and voltage sensing systems**

### Understanding ISO 26262

- Replaces IEC 61508 as functional safety standard for street vehicles (< 3.85 tons / 3500kg)
- 500+ pages, covering all steps from concept phase through production
- Implementation reduces product liability risk for OEMs

- The "V-Model"
- Higher-order processes
  - e.g. vocabulary definition & functional safety management
- Core process can be described as a "V-shaped" cyclic process
- Supporting processes and analyses

### Hazard Analysis

### Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL)

- Are determined according to fixed methods defined in the standard through parameters Exposure(E), Controllability(C) and Severity(S)
- Four ASIL levels A through D with D being the highest level
- ASIL QM level for non-safety relevant parts
- Example: HW design safety analysis

## Isolation Monitoring

### Isolation Monitoring Active vs Passive

![isolation_monitoring_0](./images/isolation_monitoring_0.png)

Isolation monitorning systems in eletric vehicles are used to monitor the isolation between the electric vehicle high-side which means the high voltage battery, and the inverter, the motor, the drivertrain of the electric vehicle as well as some auxiliary components like the heater and the AC unit, which is shown in red line. And the 12V side of the eletric vehicle which is shown in green and includes the communication line like the CAN for instance.
